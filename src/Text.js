            &#9; The year 1866 was signalised by a remarkable incident, a mysterious and
            puzzling phenomenon, which doubtless no one has yet forgotten. Not to
            mention rumours which agitated the maritime population and excited the
            public mind, even in the interior of continents, seafaring men were
            particularly excited. Merchants, common sailors, captains of vessels,
            skippers, both of Europe and America, naval officers of all countries,
            and the Governments of several states on the two continents, were
            deeply interested in the matter.

            <br /><br />

            &#9; For some time past, vessels had been met by “an enormous thing,” a long
            object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and infinitely
            larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale.

            <br /><br />

            &#9; The facts relating to this apparition (entered in various log-books)
            agreed in most respects as to the shape of the object or creature in
            question, the untiring rapidity of its movements, its surprising power
            of locomotion, and the peculiar life with which it seemed endowed. If
            it was a cetacean, it surpassed in size all those hitherto classified
            in science. Taking into consideration the mean of observations made at
            divers times,—rejecting the timid estimate of those who assigned to
            this object a length of two hundred feet, equally with the exaggerated
            opinions which set it down as a mile in width and three in length,—we
            might fairly conclude that this mysterious being surpassed greatly all
            dimensions admitted by the ichthyologists of the day, if it existed at
            all. And that it _did_ exist was an undeniable fact; and, with that
            tendency which disposes the human mind in favour of the marvellous, we
            can understand the excitement produced in the entire world by this
            supernatural apparition. As to classing it in the list of fables, the
            idea was out of the question.
